<p>
    Jessica, my love, I vow to protect you, care for you, make you laugh, make you smile, and make you happy.
</p>
<p>
    You mean the world to me, and I don't want to imagine what my life would be like without you.
</p>
<p>
    I love trying new things, exploring new places, and developing shared interests with you.
</p>
<p>
    I vow to protect support your interests --- I promise to go camping.
</p>
<p>
    I vow to make a home with you --- wherever that may be.
</p>
<p>
    I vow to build a garden with you --- even if it's just tomatoes.
</p>
<p>
    Together we will build a life we want --- a life for us.
</p>
<p>
    I vow to love you forever and always.
</p>
<p>
    Jessica, you are the love of my life.
