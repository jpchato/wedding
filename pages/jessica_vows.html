<p>
    Five years ago, I met the man of my dreams. I may not have known it at the time but the more time and adventures we had together the more I realized you're the one I'm meant to be with and the one I want to spend my life with.
</p>
<p>
    You've taken care of me when I stopped caring, and you've loved me when I wasn't able to love myself. Our journey hasn't been perfect and it may not be going forward but I promise to never quit on us, and to love you when you need it most. Even if our dreams don't work out the way we've imagined, I promise to be by your side as your wife.
</p>
<p>
    I want to spend forever with you and to me, forever looks like late night snacks and scary movies I can only half-watch. it looks like Cedar and CJ and the thousand other animals we want to add to our family. It looks like silly naked dances, sarcasm, stupid questions, and me constantly asking you what you're thinking about. To me, forever looks like you.
</p>
<p>
    So if you promise to share forever with me, then I promise to love you, trust you, and appreciate you unconditionally, and to strive to make you happy. You're my family and my best friend and now you'll be my husband.
